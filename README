This is one of my emacs configuration set for my emacs 2.23.

It contains:
-Autocomplete
-Php-mode
-Yasnippet
-Ropemacs

These four emacs modules work pretty well together.

Setup folder contains the python dependencies that you have to install.
Python setup
-Change into the python folders and (sudo) python setup.py install.
Autocomplete setup
-You can look at the Autocomplete documention. Be sure you put into the ~/.emacs.d/autocomplete directory.
-I usually fire up the emacs
-M-x load-file 
-choose ~/.emacs.d/setup/auto-complete-1.3.1/etc/install.el
-choose ~/.emacs.d/autocomplete as the target directory (you have to create the directory before)
